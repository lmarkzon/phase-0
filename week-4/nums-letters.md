# Release 1: Summarize

##What does puts do?

	- "Puts" literally writes onto the screen/console whatever you put after it on a new line. It stands for "put string", but it doesn't actually return anything (nil), it just outputs the string to the screen/console. 

##What is an integer? What is a float?

	- An integer is a whole number, or a number that does not contain any decimal points. Floats are the opposite, float is short for floating-point numbers and are numbers that contain decimal points (are not whole numbers). 

##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

	- Most programs use integers and don't use floats, floats are more-so used for academic/schooling purposes. Float division gives you the exact product of the numbers to the closest tenth, just like if you typed a division problem into a calculator and got the answer. Your answer will be a "float" since the numbers in the "question" were. Integer division, on the other hand, only gives you integer answers; it gives you your answer as a whole number (rounded down from the exact answer). It's like doing long division in school, except you "ignore" the remainder. Integer problems result in integer answers.
