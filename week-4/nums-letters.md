##Release 1: Summarize

1) What does puts do?

"Puts" literally writes onto the screen/console whatever you put after it on a new line. It stands for "put string", but it doesn't actually return anything (nil), it just outputs the string to the screen/console. 

2) What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a whole number, or a number that does not contain any decimal points. Floats are the opposite, float is short for floating-point numbers and are numbers that contain decimal points (are not whole numbers). 

3) What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Most programs use integers and don't use floats, floats are more-so used for academic/schooling purposes. Float division gives you the exact product of the numbers to the closest tenth, just like if you typed a division problem into a calculator and got the answer. Your answer will be a "float" since the numbers in the "question" were. Integer division, on the other hand, only gives you integer answers; it gives you your answer as a whole number (rounded down from the exact answer). It's like doing long division in school, except you "ignore" the remainder. Integer problems result in integer answers.

##Release 2: Try It!

irb(main):003:0> 365*24 
=> 8760 					#hours in 1 year

irb(main):004:0> 365*24*60 
=> 525600					#minutes in 1 year

irb(main):005:0> 365*24*60*10 
=> 5256000					#minutes in a decade

##Release 7: Reflect

- How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction multiplication, and division of numbers?


- What is the difference between integers and floats?


- What is the difference between integer and float division?


- What are strings? Why and when would you use them?


- What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?


- How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
