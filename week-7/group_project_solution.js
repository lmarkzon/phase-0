// Release 2 work: User Stories to Pseudocode

// input: list of numbers in the form of an array
// create variable to count how many numbers received as input (find the length of array)
// find the MEDIAN of the array of numbers by:
	// sort the list of numbers in the array from lowest to highest
	// IF the length of the array (count of the numbers on the list) is odd
		// return median, which is only the middle number
	// ELSE the length of the array is even
		// return the 2 middle numbers, those are the medians (need to make sure you are taking the MIDDLE ones)
// use a function called sum to find the sum of the list of numbers by:
	// set variable (total sum) that adds together the array of numbers received an input
		// return total sum results from above
// find the average of the array of numbers by(MEAN):
	// divide total sum variable above by the length of the array variable created above
		// output: return results, which is a single number (that can have decimal points)
