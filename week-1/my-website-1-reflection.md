## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
- Describe what open source means.
- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
- Assess the importance of using licenses.
- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

A github repository is basically the same thing as a folder on your computer, but it's on the web. 

To create a repository:
1) go to your github account on the github website and click the little plus sign (+) in the upper right-hand corner next to your account picture, select New Repository
2) Type whatever name you want to call it in the “Repository Name” box, 
3) Select “public” if you want others to be able to view it
4) Add a “MIT License” to your repository.
5) Click “Create Repository” to complete the form, you can see your new repository in your profile (under repositories). 

To clone a repository:
1) go to GitHub and go to the Repository that you want to clone
2) get the URL of the Repository you want to clone by going down to the bottom right-side of the screen where it says “HTTPS clone URL” and copy the text box below to your clipboard (little icon to the right of the box does this)
3) open your computer’s command line
4) type pwd to check where you are and then ls to see all of your directories/folders so you can decide which one you want your repository in
5) once you decide which directory you want the repository in, go to it by typing cd DirectoryName 
6) type ls to check what’s inside the directory before cloning
7) once you are in the directory that you want to put the repository in, type git clone PASTE-THE-URL
8) you’ll see some stuff execute
it may ask for your GitHub username and password
9) type ls again to see the repository cloned to your directory
10) type cd RepositoryName to go into the repository
11) you should now see the cloned repository in your own computer

First off, a license in general still lets you hold the original copyright, it just grants specific permissions for others to use that work as well. Open-source licenses make it easy for other people to contribute to a project without having to seek special permission. It also protects the original creator and makes sure that you get a least some credit for your contributions. Plus, it helps to prevent others from claiming your work as their own. Open-source software is available for virtually any application you can think of. I can understand why some developers would be nervous about it, since this type of licensing allows software to be freely used, modified, and shared over and over. But at this point it does not make me feel nervous or protective, the balance between protecting the original creator but also sharing ideas and repos makes sense to me. Licenses are important because they allow others to help you with your code as well as protect you to make sure you get some of the credit, they protect both sides.

Creating and cloning a repo are finally becoming more natural to me, I am starting to really memorize all of the new terms and vocabulary, and I now feel very comfortable navigating around my terminal - which is very exciting for me! I am still struggling with remembering each and every step for pushing and merging on GitHub, but keeping a cheat sheet with me is very helpful for right now. I did not find myself needing additional resources at this time that weren't already offered here.
