In the reflection file you just created, copy and answer the following questions (or create a video and link to it). 

- What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
	There are 6 phases of Web Design. Although they are separate stages, they are all connected and very important to the web design process.
		1. Information Gathering
			Start off by asking a lot of questions about their site: What is the purpose of the site? What are their business goals and what do they hope to achieve? Who is the target audience of the site? What kinds of content and information will the audience be looking for on the site?
		2. Planning
			This is where you take what you learned in step 1 and use it to develop a site map. A site map is a guide as to what content will be on your site, and is essential to develop a consistent, easy to use navigational system. Planning this in advance is very imporant.
		3. Design
			This is where you create a wireframe and decide on colors, font, what the site will look like. So you are taking the site-map from the last step and add details, colors, "customization". You should be using what you learned from step 1, so for example, if the target audience is kids - you might use a fun font or bright colors.
		4. Development
			This is where the actual website itself is created. You add HTML &/or CSS to make the site look like the design. This is typically done by creating first the homepage, followed by the "shell" for interior pages.
		5. Testing and Delivery
			At this point the web designer should check that all the links work, the functionality of all forms, any combatibility issues, and get any other feedback from the customer to make last minute changes.
		6. Maintenance
			Once the website is complete, the designer can offer continuous improvement and updates for the site, such as offering new content or regular site backup. 

- What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
	The primary goal of my professional website is to have a place where future employers can go to get "introduced" to who I am and my professional history/background. The website should be selling "me or my skills" as the product, it should tell users why they would want to hire me to fulfill their needs. So hopefully I can use the site in the future like a resume to get jobs and keep track of my development career. The site will include my picture, contact information, information about me, my background and education history, links to my social media accounts, and access to view my previous projects. I will be adding more in the future, but for now that is all I need.

- What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
	Since my website's goal is to sell me (like a resume) to potential employers, my target audience are the potential employers. They are recruiters and company representatives who are looking for people to hire in the web development community. They are looking to see my work history, my previous projects, my contact information, and even just looking at the website itself. If the website doesn't function properly or they don't like how its designed, then why would they consider hiring me to do exactly that for their company? The site itself needs to be complex, high functioning, impressive, and easy to use for the audience. 

- What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
	There are different primary actions users should take when visiting my website, depending on who that user may be. If someone is viewing it strictly for possible employment I would want them to first see my portfolio of previous work and contact me. If they are looking at my website for web design purposes, I would want them to look at the index, main pages, as well as ease of navigation through the website. If someone wanted to connect with me on social media or view more, I would want them to go to my Social Media page.

- What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
	UX design is not "one size fits all" because all people are different and what works with one person might have the opposite effect on someone else. Also, you can't assess the effectiveness of a UX design based only on statictics or traditional metrics such as page views or conversion rates. You can ask users for anecdotal evidence and make assumptions, but it's not like you can go to a page that shows automatic recordings of user experience statistics directly. Lastly, user experience and usability are not the same thing, user experience design addresses human factors and how the user itself feels about it, usability is more so about the efficiency of the interface and how "user-friendly" it is.

- What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
	User Experience (UX) design is the process of improving a user's satifaction when interfacing with a system. This can include enhancing the website's ease of use, utility, efficiency in performing tasks, accessibility, please, and more. Whether or not a website succeeds and flourishes depends on one major thing, how the users perceive it. Does this website give me value? Is it easy for me to use? This is so important because before the codification of user-centered designs, designers made decisions based off of what they thought looked cool or seemed to work. Websites have become so complex, have so many features, and can be accessed by so many types of mobile platforms that to be effective and keep up, they must have user-friendly designs. 

- Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
	To be completely honest I thought creating the site-map itself was slightly tedious, but I know it's only because this website is VERY basic right now and it's about a topic I'm very familiar with. So instead, if I was working on a site-map for an online store or something more complex, a site-map would be much harder and more beneficial.
