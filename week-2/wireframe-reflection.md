In the reflection file you just created, answer the following questions. 

- What is a wireframe?
	A wireframe is a visual guide that provides the skeletal framework of a website. It allows you to define the information hierarchy of your web design, which makes it easier for you to plan the layout based on how you want your user to process the information. It's like an architectural blurprint of the website to understand how to build it. It's also helpful for determining how the user interacts with the interface without being distracted by colors or styles. 

- What are the benefits of wireframing?
	Wireframes allow you to make changes to your web design more quickly and easily by having a visual representation of the early stages of the site. They also make the coding process much easier since you already know what elements you need. It allows you to improve site navigation by testing it out in the early stages, as well as make sites more design friendly.
