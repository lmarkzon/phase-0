In the reflection file you just created, answer the following questions. 

- What is a wireframe?
	A wireframe is a visual guide that provides the skeletal framework of a website. 

	exceed expectations: perhaps by saying what a wireframe isn't or how it differs from other things - or even going into more depth on what should be on it. 

- What are the benefits of wireframing?
	making changes more quickly and easily, making the coding process easier because you know what elements you need, improving site navigation, make sites more design friendly, etc. 

	exceed expectations: a student will list a number of benefits and go above and beyond the number listed above and explain exactly how they help the process. 

- Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
	

- Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

- What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

- Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
