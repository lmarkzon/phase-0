	At first it was very confusing for me to combine what we'd already learned so far with the new HTML information in my head, but now that I've gone through the process a couple times and praticed it makes sense to me now. I kept forgetting a small step here and there and still struggle a bit with remembering, I have a "cheat sheet" I refer to when I'm really stuck. It was so exciting everytime I went through the process and seeing it show up on the website. I felt like I finally understood most of what I was doing! I also really enjoyed experimenting with the html code and seeing how it showed up on the site. I would try adding and moving things here and there just to see what would happen on the site. 

   I am definitely still getting used to it, but HTML5 is really cool and interesting. I really like that I can check my site live to see what different tags look like or play with the spacing and paragraphs. I am still having a bit of trouble remembering what all of the tags are and remembering to include the end tag. I was nervous about the tags to create the (very generic) table but once I found it in the cheatsheet is was actually not bad. The more I play with different tags and things the more I'm learning and getting more comfortable with it. I'm also have difficulty figuring out the right format for images and links, but once I look up the correct format I'm good.

   Everything about HTML is an adjustment, especially the fact that we have to type everything up in sublime. Every device these days has some sort of spell check on it, our phones, computers, tablets, etc. So when typing in the text editor you have to be very careful and make sure to go back and proof-read. I entered my code into the HTML validation tool and could not understand why it was telling me I had an error, turns out I forgot the "P" in "DOCTYPE", the first word in the code and I didn't even notice, luckily my pair did. HTML code is a lot of work and very complex, but it's good because (in combination with CSS) it allows for complete customization. As of now I am using my cheat sheet to help with my html and am practicing as much as I can, updating my site as well as just reading over the code. I have also been looking at page sources of other webites to see and compare how other site's use different tags. At this point the best way to get it down is for me to just practice, practice, practice and refer to my cheatsheet until I can memorize all of the commands and tags.
