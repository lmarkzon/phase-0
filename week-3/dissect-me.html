	What are the benefits of version control? Well, version control is definitely helpful for keeping track of your own files, as well as when you are working on the same files with other people. So instead of sending a project back and forth to work on it remotely, we can all work on the same files at the same time without overwriting anything. It keeps track of your files and remembers any and all changes made to them, including who made them, and when. This is very helpful if you realize you've messed up your code and need to go back to a certain point and work from there. Version control is also great because it allows developers to share their projects with each other without affecting the original version.

	Iâ€™ve seen many developers use a black small window, typing commands into it. I never knew what developers were doing, why they were using it, and especially the code they were putting into it; it all looked very confusing! Until a few days ago; I finally got an idea what that weird looking black box was and what it was used for. So, this black box is actually called a shell (also called the command line or the terminal) and what it does is allow humans to communicate with an operating system.
