####Release 2: One-to-one Schema       
In a One-to-One relationship, you have two tables of attributes that have some relationship, but that relationship only exists in a way that any given row from Table A can have at most one matching row in Table B. It's when two things have a single relationship to one another, they are a pair. So in this case, one person is related to only one Drivers License, and any individual Drivers License can point back to only one particular person(in this particular case/country). This goes the same for the persons address, each address belongs to only one person and each person only has one address(again, in this particular case, of course in real life people can own more than one home and therefore have more than one address).
